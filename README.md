#GIT DEMO PRACTICE 
I love to practice writing code in code editors. It is more fun compared to other stuff 
I guess I am gonna be writting code for a long time 
that is my passion and dream in life and i will follow it to the end

#My dream as an entrepenuere in kenya 
I am so glad that I have built a billion kenya shilling company in kenya
